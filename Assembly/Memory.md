Every process is laid out in the same virtual memory space *regardless* of the actual memory location.

The CPU and the OS help to maintain this abstraction that makes each process feel like it is in the system alone and enjoys all memory, and is isolated from all other processes.

# How exactly does a process look like when it is layered out in Virtual Memory?
