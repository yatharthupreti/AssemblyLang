# AssemblyLang
Notes for AssemblyLang

This is intended to be used in Obsidian, by importing the entirety of the folder "assembly", as a vault.

I also used the "Typomagical" Theme while creating the notes, however, the notes are readable perfectly fine on any other theme as well.
Also, I installed the "style Settings" community plug-in, and changed the colour scheme of typomagical to "Ficus Ruby".
I'd recommend the same settings for the best reading experience on your end, however a lack of the settings, or even Obsidian itself doesn't hinder you from accessing the files at all :)

Hope this is useful :)
